        <p>Matthew Michael "Matt" Murdock is a man who had been blinded as a young boy by a radioactive substance that
            fell into his eyes from a crashed vehicle,
            and even though he lost his sight, his other four remaining senses were heightened to superhuman levels.
            After his father was killed by mobsters, Murdock was trained by Stick to become a warrior, using his
            disability as an advantage to fight for the Chaste.</p>
